To all who are capable of new impressions and fresh thought, somemodification of former beliefs and hopes has been brought by thewar. What the modification has been has depended, in each case, uponcharacter and circumstance; but in one form or another it has beenalmost universal. To me, the chief thing to be learnt through the warhas been a certain view of the springs of human action, what they are,and what we may legitimately hope that they will become. This view,if it is true, seems to afford a basis for political philosophy morecapable of standing erect in a time of crisis than the philosophy oftraditional Liberalism has shown itself to be. The following lectures,though only one of them will deal with war, all are inspired by a viewof the springs of action which has been suggested by the war. And allof them are informed by the hope of seeing such political institutionsestablished in Europe as shall make men averse to war—a hope whichI firmly believe to be realizable, though not without a great andfundamental reconstruction of economic and social life.To one who stands outside the cycle of beliefs and passions whichmake the war seem necessary, an isolation, an almost unbearableseparation from the general activity, becomes unavoidable. At thevery moment when the universal disaster raises compassion in thehighest degree, compassion itself compels aloofness from the impulseto self-destruction which has swept over Europe. The helpless longingto save men from the ruin towards which they are hastening makes itnecessary to oppose the stream, to incur hostility, to be thoughtunfeeling, to lose for the moment the power of winning belief. It isimpossible to prevent others from feeling hostile, but it is possibleto avoid any reciprocal hostility on one own part, by imaginativeunderstanding and the sympathy which grows out of it. And withoutunderstanding and sympathy it is impossible to find a cure for the evilfrom which the world is suffering.There are two views of the war neither of which seems to me adequate.The usual view in this country is that it is due to the wickednessof the Germans; the view of most pacifists is that it is due tothe diplomatic tangle and to the ambitions of Governments. I thinkboth these views fail to realize the extent to which war grows outof ordinary human nature. Germans, and also the men who composeGovernments, are on the whole average human beings, actuated by thesame passions that actuate others, not differing much from the rest ofthe world except in their circumstances. War is accepted by men whoare neither Germans nor diplomatists with a readiness, an acquiescencein untrue and inadequate reasons, which would not be possible if anydeep repugnance to war were widespread in other nations or classes.The untrue things which men believe, and the true things whichthey disbelieve, are an index to their impulses—not necessarily toindividual impulses in each case (since beliefs are contagious), but tothe general impulses of the community. We all believe many things whichwe have no good ground for believing, because, subconsciously, ournature craves certain kinds of action which these beliefs would renderreasonable if they were true. Unfounded beliefs are the homage whichimpulse pays to reason; and thus it is with the beliefs which, oppositebut similar, make men here and in Germany believe it their duty toprosecute the war.The first thought which naturally occurs to one who accepts this viewis that it would be well if men were more under the dominion of reason.War, to those who see that it must necessarily do untold harm to allthe combatants, seems a mere madness, a collective insanity in whichall that has been known in time of peace is forgotten. If impulseswere more controlled, if thought were less dominated by passion, menwould guard their minds against the approaches of war fever, anddisputes would be adjusted amicably. This is true, but it is not byitself sufficient. It is only those in whom the desire to think trulyis itself a passion who will find this desire adequate to control thepassions of war. Only passion can control passion, and only a contraryimpulse or desire can check impulse. Reason, as it is preached bytraditional moralists, is too negative, too little living, to make agood life. It is not by reason alone that wars can be prevented, but bya positive life of impulses and passions antagonistic to those thatlead to war. It is the life of impulse that needs to be changed, notonly the life of conscious thought.All human activity springs from two sources: impulse and desire. Thepart played by desire has always been sufficiently recognized. When menfind themselves not fully contented, and not able instantly to procurewhat will cause content, imagination brings before their minds thethought of things which they believe would make them happy. All desireinvolves an interval of time between the consciousness of a need andthe opportunity for satisfying it. The acts inspired by desire may bein themselves painful, the time before satisfaction can be achievedmay be very long, the object desired may be something outside ourown lives, and even after our own death. Will, as a directing force,consists mainly in following desires for more or less distant objects,in spite of the painfulness of the acts involved and the solicitationsof incompatible but more immediate desires and impulses. All this isfamiliar, and political philosophy hitherto has been almost entirelybased upon desire as the source of human actions.But desire governs no more than a part of human activity, and that notthe most important but only the more conscious, explicit, and civilizedpart.In all the more instinctive part of our nature we are dominated byimpulses to certain kinds of activity, not by desires for certain ends.Children run and shout, not because of any good which they expect torealize, but because of a direct impulse to running and shouting. Dogsbay the moon, not because they consider that it is to their advantageto do so, but because they feel an impulse to bark. It is not anypurpose, but merely an impulse, that prompts such actions as eating,drinking, love-making, quarreling, boasting. Those who believe thatman is a rational animal will say that people boast in order thatothers may have a good opinion of them; but most of us can recalloccasions when we have boasted in spite of knowing that we shouldbe despised for it. Instinctive acts normally achieve some resultwhich is agreeable to the natural man, but they are not performedfrom desire for this result. They are performed from direct impulse,and the impulse is often strong even in cases in which the normaldesirable result cannot follow. Grown men like to imagine themselvesmore rational than children and dogs, and unconsciously concealfrom themselves how great a part impulse plays in their lives. Thisunconscious concealment always follows a certain general plan. When animpulse is not indulged in the moment in which it arises, there growsup a desire for the expected consequences of indulging the impulse.If some of the consequences which are reasonably to be expected areclearly disagreeable, a conflict between foresight and impulse arises.If the impulse is weak, foresight may conquer; this is what is calledacting on reason. If the impulse is strong, either foresight will befalsified, and the disagreeable consequences will be forgotten, or, inmen of a heroic mold, the consequences may be recklessly accepted. WhenMacbeth realizes that he is doomed to defeat, he does not shrink fromthe fight; he exclaims:?                        Lay on, Macduff,    And damned be him that first cries, Hold, enough!But such strength and recklessness of impulse is rare. Most men, whentheir impulse is strong, succeed in persuading themselves, usually bya subconscious selectiveness of attention, that agreeable consequenceswill follow from the indulgence of their impulse. Whole philosophies,whole systems of ethical valuation, spring up in this way: they arethe embodiment of a kind of thought which is subservient to impulse,which aims at providing a quasi-rational ground for the indulgence ofimpulse. The only thought which is genuine is that which springs outof the intellectual impulse of curiosity, leading to the desire toknow and understand. But most of what passes for thought is inspiredby some non-intellectual impulse, and is merely a means of persuadingourselves that we shall not be disappointed or do harm if we indulgethis impulse.[1]When an impulse is restrained, we feel discomfort or even violent pain.We may indulge the impulse in order to escape from this pain, andour action is then one which has a purpose. But the pain only existsbecause of the impulse, and the impulse itself is directed to an act,not to escaping from the pain of restraining the impulse. The impulseitself remains without a purpose, and the purpose of escaping from painonly arises when the impulse has been momentarily restrained.Impulse is at the basis of our activity, much more than desire. Desirehas its place, but not so large a place as it seemed to have. Impulsesbring with them a whole train of subservient fictitious desires: theymake men feel that they desire the results which will follow fromindulging the impulses, and that they are acting for the sake of theseresults, when in fact their action has no motive outside itself. A manmay write a book or paint a picture under the belief that he desiresthe praise which it will bring him; but as soon as it is finished,if his creative impulse is not exhausted, what he has done growsuninteresting to him, and he begins a new piece of work. What appliesto artistic creation applies equally to all that is most vital in ourlives: direct impulse is what moves us, and the desires which we thinkwe have are a mere garment for the impulse.Desire, as opposed to impulse, has, it is true, a large and increasingshare in the regulation of men lives. Impulse is erratic andanarchical, not easily fitted into a well-regulated system; it may betolerated in children and artists, but it is not thought proper tomen who hope to be taken seriously. Almost all paid work is done fromdesire, not from impulse: the work itself is more or less irksome,but the payment for it is desired. The serious activities that filla man working hours are, except in a few fortunate individuals,governed mainly by purposes, not by impulses towards those activities.In this hardly any one sees an evil, because the place of impulse in asatisfactory existence is not recognized.An impulse, to one who does not share it actually or imaginatively,will always seem to be mad. All impulse is essentially blind, in thesense that it does not spring from any prevision of consequences. Theman who does not share the impulse will form a different estimate asto what the consequences will be, and as to whether those that mustensue are desirable. This difference of opinion will seem to be ethicalor intellectual, whereas its real basis is a difference of impulse.No genuine agreement will be reached, in such a case, so long as thedifference of impulse persists. In all men who have any vigorous life,there are strong impulses such as may seem utterly unreasonable toothers. Blind impulses sometimes lead to destruction and death, butat other times they lead to the best things the world contains. Blindimpulse is the source of war, but it is also the source of science,and art, and love. It is not the weakening of impulse that is to bedesired, but the direction of impulse towards life and growth ratherthan towards death and decay.The complete control of impulse by will, which is sometimes preachedby moralists, and often enforced by economic necessity, is not reallydesirable. A life governed by purposes and desires, to the exclusionof impulse, is a tiring life; it exhausts vitality, and leaves a man,in the end, indifferent to the very purposes which he has been tryingto achieve. When a whole nation lives in this way, the whole nationtends to become feeble, without enough grasp to recognize and overcomethe obstacles to its desires. Industrialism and organization areconstantly forcing civilized nations to live more and more by purposerather than impulse. In the long run such a mode of existence, if itdoes not dry up the springs of life, produces new impulses, not ofthe kind which the will has been in the habit of controlling or ofwhich thought is conscious. These new impulses are apt to be worse intheir effects than those that have been checked. Excessive discipline,especially when it is imposed from without, often issues in impulsesof cruelty and destruction; this is one reason why militarism has abad effect on national character. Either lack of vitality, or impulseswhich are oppressive and against life, will almost always result if thespontaneous impulses are not able to find an outlet. A man impulsesare not fixed from the beginning by his native disposition: withincertain wide limits, they are profoundly modified by his circumstancesand his way of life. The nature of these modifications ought to bestudied, and the results of such study ought to be taken account ofin judging the good or harm that is done by political and socialinstitutions.The war has grown, in the main, out of the life of impulse, not out ofreason or desire. There is an impulse of aggression, and an impulse ofresistance to aggression. Either may, on occasion, be in accordancewith reason, but both are operative in many cases in which they arequite contrary to reason. Each impulse produces a whole harvest ofattendant beliefs. The beliefs appropriate to the impulse of aggressionmay be seen in Bernhardi, or in the early Mohammedan conquerors, or,in full perfection, in the Book of Joshua. There is first of all aconviction of the superior excellence of one own group, a certaintythat they are in some sense the chosen people. This justifies thefeeling that only the good and evil of one own group is of realimportance, and that the rest of the world is to be regarded merely asmaterial for the triumph or salvation of the higher race. In modernpolitics this attitude is embodied in imperialism. Europe as a wholehas this attitude towards Asia and Africa, and many Germans have thisattitude towards the rest of Europe.Correlative to the impulse of aggression is the impulse of resistanceto aggression. This impulse is exemplified in the attitude of theIsraelites to the Philistines or of medieval Europe to the Mohammedans.The beliefs which it produces are beliefs in the peculiar wickedness ofthose whose aggression is feared, and in the immense value of nationalcustoms which they might suppress if they were victorious. When the warbroke out, all the reactionaries in England and France began to speakof the danger to democracy, although until that moment they had opposeddemocracy with all their strength. They were not insincere in sospeaking: the impulse of resistance to Germany made them value whateverwas endangered by the German attack. They loved democracy because theyhated Germany; but they thought they hated Germany because they loveddemocracy.The correlative impulses of aggression and resistance to aggressionhave both been operative in all the countries engaged in the war.Those who have not been dominated by one or other of these impulsesmay be roughly divided into three classes. There are, first, men whosenational sentiment is antagonistic to the State to which they aresubject. This class includes some Irish, Poles, Finns, Jews, and othermembers of oppressed nations. From our point of view, these men maybe omitted from our consideration, since they have the same impulsivenature as those who fight, and differ merely in external circumstances.The second class of men who have not been part of the force supportingthe war have been those whose impulsive nature is more or lessatrophied. Opponents of pacifism suppose that all pacifists belong tothis class, except when they are in German pay. It is thought thatpacifists are bloodless, men without passions, men who can look on andreason with cold detachment while their brothers are giving their livesfor their country. Among those who are merely passively pacifist, anddo no more than abstain from actively taking part in the war, there maybe a certain proportion of whom this is true. I think the supportersof war would be right in decrying such men. In spite of all thedestruction which is wrought by the impulses that lead to war, there ismore hope for a nation which has these impulses than for a nation inwhich all impulse is dead. Impulse is the expression of life, and whileit exists there is hope of its turning towards life instead of towardsdeath; but lack of impulse is death, and out of death no new life willcome.The active pacifists, however, are not of this class: they are not menwithout impulsive force but men in whom some impulse to which war ishostile is strong enough to overcome the impulses that lead to war. Itis not the act of a passionless man to throw himself athwart the wholemovement of the national life, to urge an outwardly hopeless cause,to incur obloquy and to resist the contagion of collective emotion.The impulse to avoid the hostility of public opinion is one of thestrongest in human nature, and can only be overcome by an unusual forceof direct and uncalculating impulse; it is not cold reason alone thatcan prompt such an act.Impulses may be divided into those that make for life and those thatmake for death. The impulses embodied in the war are among those thatmake for death. Any one of the impulses that make for life, if it isstrong enough, will lead a man to stand out against the war. Some ofthese impulses are only strong in highly civilized men; some are partof common humanity. The impulses towards art and science are among themore civilized of those that make for life. Many artists have remainedwholly untouched by the passions of the war, not from feebleness offeeling, but because the creative instinct, the pursuit of a vision,makes them critical of the assaults of national passion, and notresponsive to the myth in which the impulse of pugnacity clothesitself. And the few men in whom the scientific impulse is dominant havenoticed the rival myths of warring groups, and have been led throughunderstanding to neutrality. But it is not out of such refined impulsesthat a popular force can be generated which shall be sufficient totransform the world.There are three forces on the side of life which require no exceptionalmental endowment, which are not very rare at present, and might be verycommon under better social institutions. They are love, the instinctof constructiveness, and the joy of life. All three are checked andenfeebled at present by the conditions under which men live—not onlythe less outwardly fortunate, but also the majority of the well-to-do.Our institutions rest upon injustice and authority: it is only byclosing our hearts against sympathy and our minds against truth thatwe can endure the oppressions and unfairnesses by which we profit. Theconventional conception of what constitutes success leads most men tolive a life in which their most vital impulses are sacrificed, and thejoy of life is lost in listless weariness. Our economic system compelsalmost all men to carry out the purposes of others rather than theirown, making them feel impotent in action and only able to secure acertain modicum of passive pleasure. All these things destroy the vigorof the community, the expansive affections of individuals, and thepower of viewing the world generously. All these things are unnecessaryand can be ended by wisdom and courage. If they were ended, theimpulsive life of men would become wholly different, and the human racemight travel towards a new happiness and a new vigor. To urge this hopeis the purpose of these lectures.The impulses and desires of men and women, in so far as they are ofreal importance in their lives, are not detached one from another, butproceed from a central principle of growth, an instinctive urgencyleading them in a certain direction, as trees seek the light. So longas this instinctive movement is not thwarted, whatever misfortunesmay occur are not fundamental disasters, and do not produce thosedistortions which result from interference with natural growth. Thisintimate center in each human being is what imagination must apprehendif we are to understand him intuitively. It differs from man to man,and determines for each man the type of excellence of which he iscapable. The utmost that social institutions can do for a man is tomake his own growth free and vigorous: they cannot force him to growaccording to the pattern of another man. There are in men some impulsesand desires—for example, those towards drugs—which do not grow out ofthe central principle; such impulses, when they become strong enoughto be harmful, have to be checked by self-discipline. Other impulses,though they may grow out of the central principle in the individual,may be injurious to the growth of others, and they need to be checkedin the interest of others. But in the main, the impulses which areinjurious to others tend to result from thwarted growth, and to beleast in those who have been unimpeded in their instinctive development.Men, like trees, require for their growth the right soil and asufficient freedom from oppression. These can be helped or hinderedby political institutions. But the soil and the freedom required fora man growth are immeasurably more difficult to discover and toobtain than the soil and the freedom required for the growth of atree. And the full growth which may be hoped for cannot be definedor demonstrated; it is subtle and complex, it can only be felt by adelicate intuition and dimly apprehended by imagination and respect.It depends not only or chiefly upon the physical environment, butupon beliefs and affections, upon opportunities for action, and uponthe whole life of the community. The more developed and civilized thetype of man the more elaborate are the conditions of his growth, andthe more dependent they become upon the general state of the societyin which he lives. A man needs and desires are not confined to hisown life. If his mind is comprehensive and his imagination vivid, thefailures of the community to which he belongs are his failures, and itssuccesses are his successes: according as his community succeeds orfails, his own growth is nourished or impeded.In the modern world, the principle of growth in most men and womenis hampered by institutions inherited from a simpler age. By theprogress of thought and knowledge, and by the increase in command overthe forces of the physical world, new possibilities of growth havecome into existence, and have given rise to new claims which must besatisfied if those who make them are not to be thwarted. There is lessacquiescence in limitations which are no longer unavoidable, and lesspossibility of a good life while those limitations remain. Institutionswhich give much greater opportunities to some classes than to othersare no longer recognized as just by the less fortunate, though themore fortunate still defend them vehemently. Hence arises a universalstrife, in which tradition and authority are arrayed against libertyand justice. Our professed morality, being traditional, loses its holdupon those who are in revolt. Coöperation between the defenders of theold and the champions of the new has become almost impossible. Anintimate disunion has entered into almost all the relations of lifein continually increasing measure. In the fight for freedom, men andwomen become increasingly unable to break down the walls of the Ego andachieve the growth which comes from a real and vital union.All our institutions have their historic basis in Authority. Theunquestioned authority of the Oriental despot found its religiousexpression in the omnipotent Creator, whose glory was the sole end ofman, and against whom man had no rights. This authority descended tothe Emperor and Pope, to the kings of the Middle Ages, to the noblesin the feudal hierarchy, and even to every husband and father inhis dealings with his wife and children. The Church was the directembodiment of the Divine authority, the State and the law wereconstituted by the authority of the King, private property in land grewout of the authority of conquering barons, and the family was governedby the authority of the pater-familias.The institutions of the Middle Ages permitted only a fortunate fewto develop freely: the vast majority of mankind existed to ministerto the few. But so long as authority was genuinely respected andacknowledged even by its least fortunate subjects, medieval societyremained organic and not fundamentally hostile to life, since outwardsubmission was compatible with inward freedom because it was voluntary.The institutions of Western Christendom embodied a theory which wasreally believed, as no theory by which our present institutions can bedefended is now believed.The medieval theory of life broke down through its failure to satisfymen demands for justice and liberty. Under the stress of oppression,when rulers exceeded their theoretical powers, the victims were forcedto realize that they themselves also had rights, and need not livemerely to increase the glory of the few. Gradually it came to be seenthat if men have power, they are likely to abuse it, and that authorityin practice means tyranny. Because the claim to justice was resistedby the holders of power, men became more and more separate units, eachfighting for his own rights, not a genuine community bound togetherby an organic common purpose. This absence of a common purpose hasbecome a source of unhappiness. One of the reasons which led many mento welcome the outbreak of the present war was that it made eachnation again a whole community with a single purpose. It did this bydestroying, for the present, the beginnings of a single purpose in thecivilized world as a whole; but these beginnings were as yet so feeblethat few were much affected by their destruction. Men rejoiced in thenew sense of unity with their compatriots more than they minded theincreased separation from their enemies.The hardening and separation of the individual in the course of thefight for freedom has been inevitable, and is not likely ever to bewholly undone. What is necessary, if an organic society is to growup, is that our institutions should be so fundamentally changed asto embody that new respect for the individual and his rights whichmodern feeling demands. The medieval Empire and Church swept away theindividual. There were heretics, but they were massacred relentlessly,without any of the qualms aroused by later persecutions. And they, liketheir persecutors, were persuaded that there ought to be one universalChurch: they differed only as to what its creed should be. Among afew men of art and letters, the Renaissance undermined the medievaltheory, without, however, replacing it by anything but skepticismand confusion. The first serious breach in this medieval theory wascaused by Luther assertion of the right of private judgment and thefallibility of General Councils. Out of this assertion grew inevitably,with time, the belief that a man religion could not be determinedfor him by authority, but must be left to the free choice of eachindividual. It was in matters of religion that the battle for libertybegan, and it is in matters of religion that it has come nearest to acomplete victory.[2]The development through extreme individualism to strife, and thence,one hopes, to a new reintegration, is to be seen in almost everydepartment of life. Claims are advanced in the name of justice, andresisted in the name of tradition and prescriptive right. Each sidehonestly believes that it deserves to triumph, because two theoriesof society exist side by side in our thought, and men choose,unconsciously, the theory which fits their case. Because the battle islong and arduous all general theory is gradually forgotten; in the end,nothing remains but self-assertion, and when the oppressed win freedomthey are as oppressive as their former masters.This is seen most crudely in the case of what is called nationalism.Nationalism, in theory, is the doctrine that men, by their sympathiesand traditions, form natural groups, called “nations,?each of whichought to be united under one central Government. In the main thisdoctrine may be conceded. But in practice the doctrine takes a morepersonal form. “I belong,?the oppressed nationalist argues, “bysympathy and tradition to nation A, but I am subject to a governmentwhich is in the hands of nation B. This is an injustice, not onlybecause of the general principle of nationalism, but because nation Ais generous, progressive, and civilized, while nation B is oppressive,retrograde, and barbarous. Because this is so, nation A deserves toprosper, while nation B deserves to be abased.?The inhabitants ofnation B are naturally deaf to the claims of abstract justice, whenthey are accompanied by personal hostility and contempt. Presently,however, in the course of war, nation A acquires its freedom. Theenergy and pride which have achieved freedom generates a momentum whichleads on, almost infallibly, to the attempt at foreign conquest, orto the refusal of liberty to some smaller nation. “What? You say thatnation C, which forms part of our State, has the same rights againstus as we had against nation A? But that is absurd. Nation C is swinishand turbulent, incapable of good government, needing a strong hand ifit is not to be a menace and a disturbance to all its neighbors.?Sothe English used to speak of the Irish, so the Germans and Russiansspeak of the Poles, so the Galician Poles speak of the Ruthenes, sothe Austrians used to speak of the Magyars, so the Magyars speak ofthe South Slav sympathizers with Serbia, so the Serbs speak of theMacedonian Bulgars. In this way nationalism, unobjectionable in theory,leads by a natural movement to oppression and wars of conquest. Nosooner was France free from the English, in the fifteenth century,than it embarked upon the conquest of Italy; no sooner was Spain freedfrom the Moors than it entered into more than a century of conflictwith France for the supremacy in Europe. The case of Germany is veryinteresting in this respect. At the beginning of the eighteenth centuryGerman culture was French: French was the language of the Courts,the language in which Leibnitz wrote his philosophy, the universallanguage of polite letters and learning. National consciousness hardlyexisted. Then a series of great men created a self-respect in Germanyby their achievements in poetry, music, philosophy, and science.But politically German nationalism was only created by Napoleonoppression and the uprising of 1813. After centuries during which everydisturbance of the peace of Europe began with a French or Swedish orRussian invasion of Germany, the Germans discovered that by sufficienteffort and union they could keep foreign armies off their territory.But the effort required had been too great to cease when its purelydefensive purpose had been achieved by the defeat of Napoleon. Now, ahundred years later, they are still engaged in the same movement, whichhas become one of aggression and conquest. Whether we are now seeingthe end of the movement it is not yet possible to guess.If men had any strong sense of a community of nations, nationalismwould serve to define the boundaries of the various nations. Butbecause men only feel community within their own nation, nothing butforce is able to make them respect the rights of other nations, evenwhen they are asserting exactly similar rights on their own behalf.Analogous development is to be expected, with the course of time, inthe conflict between capital and labor which has existed since thegrowth of the industrial system, and in the conflict between men andwomen, which is still in its infancy.What is wanted, in these various conflicts, is some principle,genuinely believed, which will have justice for its outcome. The tugof war of mutual self-assertion can only result in justice through anaccidental equality of force. It is no use to attempt any bolsteringup of institutions based on authority, since all such institutionsinvolve injustice, and injustice once realized cannot be perpetuatedwithout fundamental damage both to those who uphold it and to those whoresist it. The damage consists in the hardening of the walls of theEgo, making them a prison instead of a window. Unimpeded growth in theindividual depends upon many contacts with other people, which mustbe of the nature of free coöperation, not of enforced service. Whilethe belief in authority was alive, free coöperation was compatiblewith inequality and subjection, but now equality and mutual freedomare necessary. All institutions, if they are not to hamper individualgrowth, must be based as far as possible upon voluntary combination,rather than the force of the law or the traditional authority of theholders of power. None of our institutions can survive the applicationof this principle without great and fundamental changes; but thesechanges are imperatively necessary if the world is to be withheld fromdissolving into hard separate units each at war with all the others.The two chief sources of good relations between individuals areinstinctive liking and a common purpose. Of these two, a common purposemight seem more important politically, but, in fact, it is oftenthe outcome, not the cause, of instinctive liking, or of a commoninstinctive aversion. Biological groups, from the family to the nation,are constituted by a greater or less degree of instinctive liking, andbuild their common purposes on this foundation.Instinctive liking is the feeling which makes us take pleasure inanother person company, find an exhilaration in his presence, wish totalk with him, work with him, play with him. The extreme form of it isbeing in love, but its fainter forms, and even the very faintest, havepolitical importance. The presence of a person who is instinctivelydisliked tends to make any other person more likable. An anti-Semitewill love any fellow-Christian when a Jew is present. In China, or thewilds of Africa, any white man would be welcomed with joy. A commonaversion is one of the most frequent causes of mild instinctive liking.Men differ enormously in the frequency and intensity of theirinstinctive likings, and the same man will differ greatly at differenttimes. One may take Carlyle and Walt Whitman as opposite poles in thisrespect. To Carlyle, at any rate in later life, most men and women wererepulsive; they inspired an instinctive aversion which made him findpleasure in imagining them under the guillotine or perishing in battle.This led him to belittle most men, finding satisfaction only in thosewho had been notably destructive of human life—Frederick the Great,Dr. Francia, and Governor Eyre. It led him to love war and violence,and to despise the weak and the oppressed—for example, the “thirtythousand distressed needlewomen,?on whom he was never weary of ventinghis scorn. His morals and his politics, in later life, were inspiredthrough and through by repugnance to almost the whole human race.Walt Whitman, on the contrary, had a warm, expansive feeling towardsthe vast majority of men and women. His queer catalogues seemed to himinteresting because each item came before his imagination as an objectof delight. The sort of joy which most people feel only in those whoare exceptionally beautiful or splendid Walt Whitman felt in almosteverybody. Out of this universal liking grew optimism, a belief indemocracy, and a conviction that it is easy for men to live togetherin peace and amity. His philosophy and politics, like Carlyle, werebased upon his instinctive attitude towards ordinary men and women.There is no objective reason to be given to show that one of theseattitudes is essentially more rational than the other. If a man findspeople repulsive, no argument can prove to him that they are not so.But both his own desires and other people are much more likely tofind satisfaction if he resembles Walt Whitman than if he resemblesCarlyle. A world of Walt Whitmans would be happier and more capable ofrealizing its purposes than a world of Carlyles. For this reason, weshall desire, if we can, to increase the amount of instinctive likingin the world and diminish the amount of instinctive aversion. Thisis perhaps the most important of all the effects by which politicalinstitutions ought to be judged.The other source of good relations between individuals is a commonpurpose, especially where that purpose cannot be achieved withoutknowing its cause. Economic organizations, such as unions and politicalparties are constituted almost wholly by a common purpose; whateverinstinctive liking may come to be associated with them is the resultof the common purpose, not its cause. Economic organizations, such asrailway companies, subsist for a purpose, but this purpose need onlyactually exist in those who direct the organization: the ordinarywage-earner need have no purpose beyond earning his wages. This is adefect in economic organizations, and ought to be remedied. One of theobjects of syndicalism is to remedy this defect.Marriage is (or should be) based on instinctive liking, but as soonas there are children, or the wish for children, it acquires theadditional strength of a common purpose. It is this chiefly whichdistinguishes it from an irregular connection not intended to lead tochildren. Often, in fact, the common purpose survives, and remains astrong tie, after the instinctive liking has faded.A nation, when it is real and not artificial, is founded upon a faintdegree of instinctive liking for compatriots and a common instinctiveaversion from foreigners. When an Englishman returns to Dover orFolkestone after being on the Continent, he feels something friendlyin the familiar ways: the casual porters, the shouting paper boys, thewomen serving bad tea, all warm his heart, and seem more “natural,?more what human beings ought to be, than the foreigners with theirstrange habits of behavior. He is ready to believe that all Englishpeople are good souls, while many foreigners are full of designingwickedness. It is such feelings that make it easy to organize a nationinto a governmental unit. And when that has happened, a common purposeis added, as in marriage. Foreigners would like to invade our countryand lay it waste, to kill us in battle, to humble our pride. Thosewho coöperate with us in preventing this disaster are our friends,and their coöperation intensifies our instinctive liking. But commonpurposes do not constitute the whole source of our love of country:allies, even of long standing, do not call out the same feelingsas are called out by our compatriots. Instinctive liking, resultinglargely from similar habits and customs, is an essential element inpatriotism, and, indeed, the foundation upon which the whole feelingrests.If men natural growth is to be promoted and not hindered by theenvironment, if as many as possible of their desires and needs are tobe satisfied, political institutions must, as far as possible, embodycommon purposes and foster instinctive liking. These two objects areinterconnected, for nothing is so destructive of instinctive likingas thwarted purposes and unsatisfied needs, and nothing facilitatescoöperation for common purposes so much as instinctive liking. When aman growth is unimpeded, his self-respect remains intact, and he isnot inclined to regard others as his enemies. But when, for whateverreason, his growth is impeded, or he is compelled to grow into sometwisted and unnatural shape, his instinct presents the environment ashis enemy, and he becomes filled with hatred. The joy of life abandonshim, and malevolence takes the place of friendliness. The malevolenceof hunchbacks and cripples is proverbial; and a similar malevolenceis to be found in those who have been crippled in less obvious ways.Real freedom, if it could be brought about, would go a long way towardsdestroying hatred.There is a not uncommon belief that what is instinctive in uscannot be changed, but must be simply accepted and made the bestof. This is by no means the case. No doubt we have a certain nativedisposition, different in different people, which coöperates withoutside circumstances in producing a certain character. But even theinstinctive part of our character is very malleable. It may be changedby beliefs, by material circumstances, by social circumstances, and byinstitutions. A Dutchman has probably much the same native dispositionas a German, but his instincts in adult life are very different owingto the absence of militarism and of the pride of a Great Power. It isobvious that the instincts of celibates become profoundly differentfrom those of other men and women. Almost any instinct is capable ofmany different forms according to the nature of the outlets whichit finds. The same instinct which leads to artistic or intellectualcreativeness may, under other circumstances, lead to love of war. Thefact that an activity or belief is an outcome of instinct is thereforeno reason for regarding it as unalterable.This applies to people instinctive likes and dislikes as well asto their other instincts. It is natural to men, as to other animals,to like some of their species and dislike others; but the proportionof like and dislike depends on circumstances, often on quite trivialcircumstances. Most of Carlyle misanthropy is attributable todyspepsia; probably a suitable medical regimen would have given him acompletely different outlook on the world. The defect of punishment,as a means of dealing with impulses which the community wishes todiscourage, is that it does nothing to prevent the existence ofthe impulses, but merely endeavors to check their indulgence by anappeal to self-interest. This method, since it does not eradicate theimpulses, probably only drives them to find other outlets even when itis successful in its immediate object; and if the impulses are strong,mere self-interest is not likely to curb them effectually, since it isnot a very powerful motive except with unusually reasonable and ratherpassionless people. It is thought to be a stronger motive than it is,because our moods make us deceive ourselves as to our interest, andlead us to believe that it is consistent with the actions to which weare prompted by desire or impulse.Thus the commonplace that human nature cannot be changed is untrue.We all know that our own characters and those of our acquaintance aregreatly affected by circumstances; and what is true of individualsis true also of nations. The root causes of changes in average humannature are generally either purely material changes—for instance, ofclimate—or changes in the degree of man control over the materialworld. We may ignore the purely material changes, since these do notmuch concern the politician. But the changes due to man increasedcontrol over the material world, by inventions and science, are ofprofound present importance. Through the industrial revolution, theyhave radically altered the daily lives of men; and by creating hugeeconomic organizations, they have altered the whole structure ofsociety. The general beliefs of men, which are, in the main, a productof instinct and circumstance, have become very different from whatthey were in the eighteenth century. But our institutions are not yetsuited either to the instincts developed by our new circumstances, orto our real beliefs. Institutions have a life of their own, and oftenoutlast the circumstances which made them a fit garment for instinct.This applies, in varying degrees, to almost all the institutions whichwe have inherited from the past: the State, private property, thepatriarchal family, the Churches, armies and navies. All of these havebecome in some degree oppressive, in some measures hostile to life.In any serious attempt at political reconstruction, it is necessaryto realize what are the vital needs of ordinary men and women. Itis customary, in political thought, to assume that the only needswith which politics is concerned are economic needs. This view isquite inadequate to account for such an event as the present war,since any economic motives that may be assigned for it are to a greatextent mythical, and its true causes must be sought for outside theeconomic sphere. Needs which are normally satisfied without consciouseffort remain unrecognized, and this results in a working theory ofhuman needs which is far too simple. Owing chiefly to industrialism,many needs which were formerly satisfied without effort now remainunsatisfied in most men and women. But the old unduly simple theory ofhuman needs survives, making men overlook the source of the new lackof satisfaction, and invent quite false theories as to why they aredissatisfied. Socialism as a panacea seems to me to be mistaken in thisway, since it is too ready to suppose that better economic conditionswill of themselves make men happy. It is not only more material goodsthat men need, but more freedom, more self-direction, more outlet forcreativeness, more opportunity for the joy of life, more voluntarycoöperation, and less involuntary subservience to purposes not theirown. All these things the institutions of the future must help toproduce, if our increase of knowledge and power over Nature is to bearits full fruit in bringing about a good life.
